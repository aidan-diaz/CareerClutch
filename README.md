CareerClutch is a hitlisting application that allows users to keep track of companies that they are looking to apply to during their job hunt.

## Tech Used:

- React
- CSS + Tailwind
- JSON Server (to simulate a REST API)


## Features

- enter a company, job title, and location for each hitlist item
- filter entered companies by company name
- delete a company from their hitlist if they wish to do so

## Future Goals

- allow users to update existing companies
- allow users to enter link to job description
- prevent a user from saving a company if they do not enter all fields




## React + Vite


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
